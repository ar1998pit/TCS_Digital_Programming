 Algo :-
 1. Initally the amount available in your bank acct is Re. 1
 2. The Possible hack is nothing but you can take the multiple of 10 or multiple of 20
 3. If you can make the given amount, then simply return Yes
 4. We would return NO
 
 Base Condition:

 Otherwise , we have to check HACK of 10 and 20 with initial amount 1
 For 10-->i and 20->hey.

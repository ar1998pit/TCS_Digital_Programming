There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. 
The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. 
Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top.

Examples:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
There is only one way to climb 1 stair

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
There are two ways: (1, 1) and (2)

Input: n = 4
Output: 5
(1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (2, 2)

Method 1: The first method uses the technique of recursion to solve this problem.

       int a = sc.nextInt(); 
        
        System.out.println(countWays(a)); 
    } 
    
	 public static int fib(int n)

        if (n <= 1) 
            return n; 
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2); 
    } 
  
    static int countWays(int s) 
    { 
        return fib(s + 1); 
    }
